# A Modern Java Pet Store
## Introduction to Kubernetes & Istio


####This is part of a [series](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/arvr-for-beginners-meetup-tickets-42659330205) hosted by [Cloudinary and IBM Code SF](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ca--san-francisco/ibm-code-sf/), a monthly meet up held in the San Francisco Bay Area.

You have been hearing about containers and Kubernetes but not sure what it is? Then join us at this meetup, we will be doing an introduction to Kubernetes - what it is, how it works and what benefits you get as a developer. We will also briefly cover Istio - an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices and why/when you should use it.

We will demonstrate the example of k8s jPetStore - a Shazam for Pets app \(with the capability to detect the endangered species - at the moment just a tiger\).
