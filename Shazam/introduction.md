# Shazam for Pets — Java PetStore on Kubernetes with New UX {#1fb4}

This is the first of series of blog posts on my short adventure on making a great AI powered application — **Shazam for Pets** — from an old fashion and so 2001 Web 2.0 Java application.

As a Java developer I maintain my skills in order to be competitive on the market. When I heard all those buzz words about containers: Docker, Kubernetes, and modernizing your application for ☁️ I decided to give it a try. In February 2018 I participated in the Index Conference 2018 in San Francisco🌉. At the conference I demoed a small Code for Good Quiz for which I modernized JPetStore — an old fashioned Java EE application — with Kubernetes and AI.

JPetStore is a traditional Java Enterprise Edition application that demonstrates the best practices on deploying the JAVA EE application with the latest standards. I got my hands on its version with Spring and MySQL DB.

Freeman:_The Pet Store Demo is the reference application for J2EE that showcases the main features of the J2EE platform. It’s part of the Blueprints program that seeks to provide best practice guidelines for J2EE application development._

Implicit in the Java Pet Store is a set of components that can be reused in other contexts. For example, the Java Pet Store includes a shopping cart, a mailer, and inventory components. It’s our intention that this reference application can be used as a framework for building real-world applications. In addition, recommendations about typical design decisions need to be made, such as JSP versus servlets, stateful versus stateless session beans, and container- versus bean-managed persistence.

Then I followed these simple steps to modernize infrastructure of the application. I containerized it and brought it to the cloud, and I added an AI powered mobile App as the new UX.
